## **1. Introduction**

Aiming to reconcile my academic background in Geography (bachelor's degree) and newly acquired coding skills, I propose a collaborative platform to house speleological data from the Quadrilátero Ferrífero region, where I worked as an environmental consultant for 12 years.

This platform has statistical, database search, and webGIS features that are engaging and collaborative. The site aims for precision and reliability in recording speleological information, confers transparency and promotes the free flow of information. 

The first issue in designing the website, after deciding on the problem statement, in my creative process is the name of the web application. The site’s name comes from a linguistic accident in my poor or literal translation of what I know in Portuguese as 'espeleometria,' a widely used term, into English, resulting in 'speleometric,' which is actually more commonly known in English as 'cave metrics.' I added an 's' at the end because I thought the name sounded better. During the deployment process on Heroku, I was happy to discover that my fortunate accident is an unregistered name on the platform.

## **2. UX Design**

### **2.1. Strategy/Scope and Structural Plane**

My choice for this project is guided, above all, by access to information. In recent years, I have worked on speleological studies in which the metrics of caves can, by a small statistical margin, preserve them or allow them to be suppressed. In a scenario in which economic interest conflicts with the preservation of speleological heritage, given that the genetic process of caves is the same as the concentration of high iron content, forming iron ore deposits, every decision must be grounded (pun intended) by the most complete and high-quality cave data.

In recent years, environmental agencies have tried to generate and maintain a reliable database of cavities in the state of Minas Gerais. However, this database only contains spatial data on the caves and does not provide metric data. 

In addition, different environmental studies list different and non-centralized data. This may be due to developers' (mining companies) unwillingness to share information, given the possibility of changes in cutting metrics and losing more deposits. Finally, one could point to a market reserve of specialized consulting companies, which creates a market reserve in possession of a comprehensive database. 

In order to break away from the practices listed in the previous paragraphs and ensure the constitutional right to request and obtain information from government bodies as granted by the Freedom of Information Act, I conceived of this web application. Integrating a database will make the process more transparent and accessible to all stakeholders, contributing to the proper management of speleological heritage.

Speleometrics aims to create a centralized, transparent platform for gathering and sharing cave metrics specific to the Quadrilátero Ferrífero region. This platform will serve various stakeholders—speleologists, conservationists, environmental consultancy companies, public agencies, academics, and cave enthusiasts—by providing accessible and accurate data on caves. The user-friendly dashboard will offer insights into key cave attributes (such as length, depth, area, volume and others), helping in decision-making for environmental licensing, conservation, and research.

In sum the website aims for:
- Allowing input, update, display, and storage of cave metrics data.
- The data should be accessible by all listed stakeholders.
- To provide a user-friendly dashboard to the users, displaying cave metrics specific to the Quadrilátero Ferrífero region.

### **2.2. User Stories**

### **2.3. Skeleton & Surface Planes**

#### Wireframes

The wireframes were created using Balsamiq. At this stage, along with the user stories, it was possible to identify the functionalities, pages, and data to be presented in later phases. 

Although the design is simple, comparing the final result with the wireframes shows that the production phase successfully implemented what was proposed at the outset.

#### Datbase Schema

The cave registration system was structured using a relational database schema which the models are: User, Profile, Cave, and Report. The models are connected by relationships defined through foreign key associations. User is structured by Django AllAuth, a set of applications that automate tasks related to addressing authentication, registration, and account management.

The Cave, which stores the main data collected by the website, is linked to the User model via a foreign key, establishing that each cave entry is created and managed by a specific user, ensuring ownership of cave records. The Cave model includes fields like cave_name, latitude, longitude, elevation, length, depth, area, and volume, each with specific validation constraints to ensure consistency in data entry.

The Profile model, in turn, is associated with the User model through a one-to-one relationship established by the user. This allows each user to have a detailed profile while maintaining the core authentication provided by Django All Auth. Additionally, the Profile model handles user information, allowing them to edit their profile and access the website's main functions, like adding a cave, provided the user provides an email_for_contact, bio, and display name, which are not mandatory fields. This relationship ensures the integrity of user data, connecting it back to cave entries and reports through consistent foreign key relationships across the models.

Finally, The Report model captures the relationship between users and cave entries in terms of data inconsistencies. A report gathers info about the reporting user, the cave being reported, the cave owner, and the inconsistency. This is managed through foreign keys that ensure each report correctly maps out the cave and the users involved.

### **2.4. Design** 

For the page design, I drew inspiration from the interface I used most often while preparing environmental impact reports, which in this case was Microsoft Word. The blank page in the centre with grey borders would bring comfort to the centred content and familiarity to users, most of whom share a similar professional background to mine.

As for the logo, it went through several versions and colours. After testing a few possibilities, one of which was my user profile photo, I decided on something more elemental and simple. The capital greek letter omega is commonly used as a cartographic symbol to designate a cave, and this was present in several versions of the logo. Regarding the colour, I chose orange, as it resembles the soil developed from the rocks of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero.

#### Colour Scheme


I chose a palette that would ornate with orange, white, and grey for the colour scheme that inspired the site's design. Since much of the content will be presented through text and tables, to maintain a clean appearance, I decided to choose a dark tone for the text. To that end, I checked the accessibility of a dark blue shade and a white tone. I opted out of shades of grey or black for this purpose, as I found the dark blue tone more elegant.

#### Font

I chose Josefin Sans for the items in the nav-bar and Inter Sans for the rest of the text.

### **2.4. Agile and Project Managing** 

I tried to implement Agile Methodology during the planning of my full stack framework project. The planning was conducted with [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/hpesciotti/projects/3). I chose to limit my entries to Tasks, User Stories, linking them through GitHub interface. 

I had initially around 30 days to execute the project, as suggest by the CI Scheduler. I would like to point out that was a very short time frame to develop a full-stack application and taking into account my learning curve with Django and Boostrap, I think the endproduct can achive the MVP status. 

Here is a draft of my initial planning divided um four sprints, tackling the various content involved on Speleometrics.

| Sprint | Start       | Finish      | Content                                    |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1      | 15/09/2024  | 21/09/2024  | Design, Wireframes, Sign-In (Django AllAuth) |
| 2      | 22/09/2024  | 28/09/2024  | Defining the models, Profiles and Caves    |
| 3      | 29/09/2024  | 05/10/2024  | Statistics, Reports, Maps and Frontend Development |
| 4      | 06/10/2024  | 13/10/2024  | Styling/Testing/Documentation               |

### **3. Features**

#### **3.1. User view**

To ensure an engaging interface and data protection, it was necessary to establish some permissions for the website users.
Moreover, the classification of users reflects upon the user's access to some pages. 
The following charts show the accessibility of the features per user type.

| Feature / User Type       | Unlogged User | Logged User | Superuser |
|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Home**                  | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| **About**                 | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| **Caves**                 |               |             |           |
| - Map Search              | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Table Search            | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Cave Page               | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Report Cave             | Not Visible    | Visible     | Visible   |
| **User Area**             |               |             |           |
| - Register a Cave         | Not Visible    | Visible     | Visible   |
| - My Caves                | Not Visible    | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Edit Cave               | Not Visible    | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Edit Profile            | Not Visible    | Visible     | Visible   |
| **Reports**               |               |             |           |
| - Report List             | Not Visible    | Not Visible  | Visible   |
| - Report Page             | Not Visible    | Not Visible  | Visible   |

#### **3.2. CRUD Functionality**

The Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionalities are planned for Speleometrics. Through the Database Model, it is clear that full CRUD functionality is available for the Cave database, meaning that any user who has registered a cave and a superuser has access to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Regarding user profiles, the only operation currently unavailable is the ability to delete them. Since cave records are crucial to the web application's purpose, deleting profiles could result in data loss (cascade effect). Therefore, the option to delete a profile was not initially planned. Additionally, as transparency is a guiding principle of the project, most functionalities are available in Read mode, even for users who are not logged in. The following chart displays the CRUD functions per page per user.

| Feature / User Type       | Unlogged User | Logged User           | Superuser         |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| **Home**                  | R             | R                     | R                  |
| **About**                 | R             | R                     | R                  |
| **Cave**                  |               |                       |                    |
| - Table Search            | R             | R                     | R                  |
| - Cave Page               | R             | All = R - If owner = U, D | R, U, D          |
| - Report Cave             | R             | C                     | C                  |
| **User Area**             |               |                       |                    |
| - Register a Cave         | R             | C                     | C                  |
| - My Caves                | R             | U, D                  | R, U, D            |
| - Edit Cave               | R             | If owner = U else -  | U                  |
| - Edit Profile            | R             | All = R / If owner = U | All = R / If owner = U |
| **Reports**               |               |                       |                    |
| - Report List             | -             | -                     | R, D               |
| - Report Page             | -             | -                     | R, D               |


### **4.1. Features Showcase**

#### Header

The header features two versions tailored for both mobile and desktop views. Both versions include the site's logo, which has hover and focus functions aligned with the adopted colour scheme. The logo follows current trends by maintaining a minimalist design.

In the desktop version, links are presented as nav-pills, responsive to hover, focus, and active states. The purpose of the nav-pills is to effectively indicate the section or area of the site being accessed. It is important to note that the "add cave" section, which depends on user validation and is accessed through the user area, sits between the cave and user area tabs.

The navbar is also responsive to user type. When the user is not logged in, the user area is visible but appears as disabled, prompting the user to log in or sign up. Additionally, only superusers can access the reports tab, which remains invisible to other users.

The mobile version includes the logo and stack bars for the drop-down menu. This version lists the sublinks under the Caves section directly without requiring additional clicks. Similar to the desktop version, the responsiveness to the user's status is also applied.

pip install urllib3==1.26.20
pip install whitenoise==5.3.0
```
  
- After the insatalation process run ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` in the terminal.  
- Create a new Django project in the terminal ```django-admin startproject speleometrics .```
- Create a new app eg. ```python3 mangage.py startapp caves```
- Register caves in **INSTALLED_APPS** in **settings.py** as 'caves',
- Run ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` and enter credentials to create a superuser, allowing Admin access.
- Run migrations with commands: ```python3 manage.py makemigrations``` and ```python3 manage.py migrate```
- Create an **env.py** to store all confidential data such as the **DATABASE_URL** and **SECRET_KEY**. 

```import os
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<CI's data base>"
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL")
```

- Add envy.py to must be added to your **gitignore**, so it will not be upload to GitHub.
- Reference the file in your project's **settings.py**: 
For adding to **settings.py**:

```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
import env
```

- Replace **DATABASES** with:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
```

- Set up the templates directory in **settings.py**:
    Under ``BASE_DIR`` enter ``TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ‘templates’)``
    Update ``TEMPLATES = 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`` with:

```
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth')
```

- Create the media, static and templates directories in top level of project file in IDE workspace.

-  Create a Procfile in the project repository for Heroku deployment, containing the following line:
web: gunicorn speleometrics.wsgi

-  Run migrations again to ensure all database changes are applied.

### **6.4. Cloudinary API**

Cloudinary offers a cloud-based solution for media storage. All images uploaded by users in the Speleometrics project are hosted on this platform.

To get started, create a new account at Cloudinary and add your Cloudinary API environment variable to your env.py file and Heroku Config Vars. In your project workspace:
  - Include the Cloudinary libraries in the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py file, in the following order:
```
   'cloudinary_storage',  
   'django.contrib.staticfiles',  
   'cloudinary',
```
- Add to **env.py** and link up with **settings.py**: ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="cloudinary://...."``` 
- Configure Cloudinary as the storage for media and static files in settings.py with the following settings:

```
STATIC_URL = '/static/
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'  
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]  
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')‌  
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'  
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

- Enter an app name and choose your region. Click '**Create App**'. 
-  In the Deploy tab, click on the '**Settings**', reach the '**Config Vars**' section and click on '**Reveal Config Vars**'. Here you will enter KEY:VALUE pairs for the app to run successfully. The KEY:VALUE pairs that you will need are your: 
   
   - Set CLOUDINARY_URL** 
   - Set DATABASE_URL**
   - Set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to 1
  
- Add the Heroku host name into **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in your projects **settings.py file** -> ```['herokuappname', ‘localhost’, ‘8000 port url’].```
- Once you are sure that you have set up the required files including your requirements.txt and Procfile, you have ensured that **DEBUG=False**, save your project, add the files, commit for initial deployment and push the data to GitHub.
- Go to the '**Deploy**' tab and choose GitHub as the Deployment method.
- Search for the repository name, select the branch that you would like to build from, and connect it via the '**Connect**' button.
-  Choose from '**Automatic**' or '**Manual**' deployment options, I chose the 'Manual' deployment method. Click '**Deploy Branch**'.
- Once the waiting period for the app to build has finished, click the '**View**' link to bring you to your newly deployed site. If you receive any errors, Heroku will display a reason in the app build log for you to investigate. *
